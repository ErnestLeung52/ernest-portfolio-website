# Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This is my personal portfolio website, a project that showcases my skills, experience, and projects. I built this website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend.

## Features

The website includes the following pages and features:

-   **Home**: A brief introduction about me.
-   **About**: Detailed information about my skills, experiences, and educational background.
-   **Projects**: A showcase of my projects, including a brief description, technologies used, and links to live demos and source code.
-   **Contact**: A contact form where visitors can send me a message.

## Setup & Installation

If you'd like to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repo-link>`.
2. Navigate into the project directory `cd <project-folder>`.
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Usage & Deployment

For local development, the site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

For production deployment, I recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the platform built by the creators of Next.js. You can deploy straight from your repository. Follow the [official Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
